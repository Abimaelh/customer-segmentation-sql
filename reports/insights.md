# Segmentation Insights
RFM analysis confirmed that **monetary value is a strong indicator of customer importance** For example, customer 14646 generated the highest total spend. **Purchase frequency alone was not a reliable predictor of value**: some customers with very high order counts spent less overall, while others made fewer but significantly larger purchases. **Average Order Value (AOV)** analysis reinforced this trend. **One-time, high-ticket buyers exhibit very high AOVs**, while frequent purchasers typically buy lower-priced items more often.

# Targeted Strategies

1. **VIP Rewards for High-AOV Customers** – Develop premium membership tiers or exclusive perks for customers who make large, infrequent purchases.

2. **Balanced Incentives for Frequent Buyers** – Reward frequent purchasers who exceed an AOV threshold (e.g., streak rewards or loyalty bonuses) to encourage higher-value transactions.

3. **Reactivation Campaigns for Low-Value Segments** – Send targeted marketing emails to low-AOV, low-RFM customers to nudge additional purchases and guide them into either the high-AOV or high-frequency track.
