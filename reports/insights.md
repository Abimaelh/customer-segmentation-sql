# Segmentation Insights
RFM analysis confirmed that **monetary value is a strong indicator of customer importance** For example, customer 14646 generated the highest total spend. **Purchase frequency alone was not a reliable predictor of value**: some customers with very high order counts spent less overall, while others made fewer but significantly larger purchases. **Average Order Value (AOV)** analysis reinforced this trend. **One-time, high-ticket buyers exhibit very high AOVs**, while frequent purchasers typically buy lower-priced items more often.

## RFM Scores
RFM scores were calculated for each customer and divided into quintiles to better understand and segment purchasing behavior. Each score combines three dimensions: Recency (how recently a customer made a purchase), Frequency (how often they purchase), and Monetary (how much they spend in total).

Each dimension is ranked from 1 to 5, and the sum of these three values produces an RFM Sum ranging from 3 to 15. Lower scores (3–6) indicate less recent, low-spend, or infrequent customers; mid-range scores (7–10) reflect moderately engaged customers; and higher scores (11–15) identify recent, high-frequency, high-spend customers.

The majority of customers fall within the medium range, showing steady but not exceptional purchasing activity, while a smaller proportion achieves higher RFM scores, representing your most valuable, high-spending customers.

# Targeted Strategies

1. **VIP Rewards for High-AOV Customers** – Develop premium membership tiers or exclusive perks for customers who make large, infrequent purchases.

2. **Balanced Incentives for Frequent Buyers** – Reward frequent purchasers who exceed an AOV threshold (e.g., streak rewards or loyalty bonuses) to encourage higher-value transactions.

3. **Reactivation Campaigns for Low-Value Segments** – Send targeted marketing emails to low-AOV, low-RFM customers to nudge additional purchases and guide them into either the high-AOV or high-frequency track.
